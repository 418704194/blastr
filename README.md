# blastr - Using NCBI BLAST with R

The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool ([BLAST](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/))
is a suite of programs that are used to find regions of local similarity
between biological sequences and to calculate the statistical significance
of the matches.

The `blastr` package provides R wrappers around the most common BLAST
functions, allows both local and remote queries using standard `DNAStringSet`
or `AAStringSet` representations of sequences, and provides parsers for 
BLAST XML and tabular output.
